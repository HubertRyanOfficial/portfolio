        Hi I am Hubert Ryan Rodrigues dos Santos, you won't forget this name in
        the future.

      <p className="text-base text-justify">
        I'm 22 years old and a highly experienced <b>Front End</b>,{" "}
        <b>Mobile</b> and <b>Back-end</b> developer with over{" "}
        <u>6 years of professional experience</u> in the field. My main
        expertise revolves around <b>JavaScript</b>, web development and mobile
        applications.

      <p>
        Software development has always been a passion in my life. I started
        programming when I was 11 years and have been doing it so since then. I
        have always been passionate about creating things in this incredible
        world, and I saw that with technology I could create useful and real
        things for everyone.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Apart from my programming career, I am a self-taught person passionate
        about mathematics, philanthropy and things that happen in the world. If
        you want to know more, follow me on social media.

        Why I founded Tapedin, Cloudsky and Sixcry
      </h2>
      <p className="text-base text-justify">
        <b>Why Tapedin?</b> I founded it with the aim of improving the
        experience by sharing everyday moments, the main motivation for founding{" "}
        <b>Tapedin</b> is to break the parallel reality among social media users
        today. I believe that with Tapedin I can change the way people
        communicate around the world by sharing real moments and reactions
        rather than just clicks.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-bas  text-justify">
        <b>Why Cloudsky?</b> Seeing the absurd growth of Internet users with the
        responsibility of having several passwords to provide services in this
        new world, I combined all my skills to create a password manager and
        then create an encryption service. With Cloudsky you will no longer need
        to worry about where your passwords are or whether they will be tracked
        or found other than by yourself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-base  text-justify">
        <b>Why Sixcry?</b> If you read the previous paragraph, you already
        understand where it came from. Today on the internet we can say that
        most services are not encrypted and this will be the next generation
        after AI. With Sixcry, all services will be able to use private
        end-to-end encryption, making it impossible to identify intruders with
        various encryption models. Sixcry is only available for. Cloudsky
        service as the first use case, but it will soon be available to everyone
        with a very small price.
